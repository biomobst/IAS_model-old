This folder contains all individual SDM results (species level) as PNG files. The maps show suitable habitat for each species as European projection (name.Eur.png) and Swedish projection (name.Swe.png). The scale is linear from white to dark brown, with 0 indicating lowest probability to find suitable habitat, and 1 indicating highest  probability to find suitable habitat. Training points (based on known observations) are indicated with red circle in the maps.
