# IAS_model
This repo contains a workflow for running species distribution models for marine species and identify potential distribution areas for alien / invasive species in Swedish waters. The workflow was built under the commission of the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM)” and is formally part of the report “Provtagningsdesign med omdrev för övervakning av främmande arter enligt eRAS” by Marine Monitoring AB, Senalytics AB, and the Swedish National Veterinary Institute.
